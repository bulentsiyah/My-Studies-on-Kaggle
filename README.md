### One-shot Image Recognition

People may ask why have they used One-shot image recognition method though there are other state of art models like CNN and Hierarchical Bayesian Program Learning. The main reason for people using this method is the lack of data. The state of art Machine Learning Algorithms work very well when there is a huge amount of data but can fail miserably if there is a data scarcity.
